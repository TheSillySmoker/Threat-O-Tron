Task description:

Our client is an information-gathering agency that we cannot name for legal and contractual reasons. 
This client employs field agents that often find themselves gathering information in highly secure facilities.

Your task is to write a computer program in C# and .NET 8.0 that presents a menu allowing the agent to specify certain obstacles to the agent's mission,
and provides the agent with information upon request, including the ability to request a safe path to a particular objective.

You are required to use an object-oriented approach to implementing the solution, and you are required to produce high quality, 
thoroughly documented source code so that the software can be maintained later. Your code must also feature proper use of exception handling.
